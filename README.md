# VulkanTutorial
This is my repository for the vulkan tutorial on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ . After the tutorial I want to include Vulkan in my CortexEngine so this is only for learning purpose. 


If you have some problems with executing, be sure you have installed the VulkanSDK 1.1.73.0 from the LunarG website on your C:/. 
I made the tutorial only running on x64, so it won't compile on x86.
